            Throughout the course of the summer, I have learned a great deal of new concepts. These new topics are not just limited to computer code. Along with learning proper source control, how to use html, css, and javascript to code a website, and setting up a database communicating data throughout the model, I also grasped skills pertinent to the workplace. I believe these workplace skills to invaluable, more so than any of those related to fullstack development. Of these skills, communicating with both peers and superiors is probably most applicable to just about anything and everything. I found communication to be the key to success. In addition to communication skills, scheduling and time management were also valuable takeaways.

            This experience is close to priceless in value to me because I was able to see how much goes into a project. I was also able to take a peek into the professional realm where I may want to be in for my career. The connections I made will also help me in the future. I couldn't be more grateful for being able to take part in the first summer of Code the Way.

            I believe that the Code the Way internship program has been a life changing experience for all involved. Before the summer experience, we were all rather inexperienced students with just a basic understanding of software development and a curiosity to learn more. As the end of the summer quickly approaches, I can confidently say that my teammates and I have grown immensely in our knowledge of not only software development and the agile method but the business world as a whole.
