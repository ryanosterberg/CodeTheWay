            Throughout the course of the summer, I have learned a great deal of new concepts. These new topics are not just limited to computer code. Along with learning proper source control, how to use html, css, and javascript to code a website, and setting up a database communicating data throughout the model, I also grasped skills pertinent to the workplace. I believe these workplace skills to invaluable, more so than any of those related to fullstack development. Of these skills, communicating with both peers and superiors is probably most applicable to just about anything and everything. I found communication to be the key to success. In addition to communication skills, scheduling and time management were also valuable takeaways.
